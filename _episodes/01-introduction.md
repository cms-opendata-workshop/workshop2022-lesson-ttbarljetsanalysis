## Introduction

This simplified analysis will be working towards a measurement of the top and anti-top quark production cross section $$ \sigma_{t\bar{t}} $$.
The data are produced in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV at the beginning of Run 2 of the LHC. We will be examining the lepton+jets final state
$$
t\bar{t} \rightarrow (bW^{+})(\bar{b}W_{-}) \rightarrow bq\bar{q} bl^{-}\bar{\nu_{l}}
$$
which is characterized by one lepton (here we look at electrons and muons only), significant missing transverse energy, and four jets, two of which are identified as b-jets.
